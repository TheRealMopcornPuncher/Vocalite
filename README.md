# Vocalite
Automatic voice-to-text transcription with handy Discord support to send messages without switching applications.

Support is only for Windows currently. I will add further support for Linux and Mac in later versions.

The process?

First, detect vocal activity,
Then, save a temporary buffer on your PC of that vocal activity.
Send audio file (temporary buffer) for processing (Cleanup, then Discord magic),
Repeat from the first step.

### I hate anyone who isn't open source, you suck

So enjoy the source code for anyone curious about how I did something... though you really shouldn't be, I'm a terrible
programmer and taking any inspiration from my work is a risk you should consider (Seriously, I mean it, I suck)

This is also for full transparency, so that you know that what you're downloading isn't some disgusting, evil secret crypto garbage, adware, or whatever the hell else.

I built this because I wanted it for myself, and I enjoy sharing accessibility. (Seriously, you gatekeeping, closed-source hogs are the worst, have a horrible day.)

Enjoy <3
